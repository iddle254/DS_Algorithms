##H-index
###Problem
>Jorge is a physicist who has published many research papers and wants to know how much impact they have had in the academic community. To measure impact, he has developed a metric, H-index, to score each of his papers based on the number of times it has been cited by other papers. Specifically, the H-index score of a researcher is the largest integer H such that the researcher has H papers with at least H citations each.
>Jorge has written N papers in his lifetime. The i-th paper has Ci citations. Each paper was written sequentially in the order provided, and the number of citations that each paper has will never change. Please help Jorge determine his H-index score after each paper he wrote.
###Input
>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing N, the number of papers Jorge wrote. The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ci, the number of citations that the i-th paper has.
###Output
>For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is a space-separated list of N integers. The i-th integer is Jorge's H-index score after writing his i-th paper.
